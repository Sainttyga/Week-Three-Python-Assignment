### Discount Calculator  

This Python program calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount. If the discount percentage is **20% or more**, it applies the discount; otherwise, the original price remains unchanged.  

---

## How It Works  

1. The user is prompted to enter the **original price** of an item.  
2. The user is then asked to enter the **discount percentage**.  
3. If the discount is **20% or higher**, it calculates and applies the discount.  
4. If the discount is **less than 20%**, the original price remains unchanged.  
5. The final price is displayed to the user.
